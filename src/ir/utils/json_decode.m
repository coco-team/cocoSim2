%JSON_DECODE parses a JSON string and returns a MATLAB object.
%   JSON objects are converted to structures and JSON arrays are converted to
%   vectors (all elements of the same type) or cell arrays (different types).
%   'null' values are converted to NaN.
%
%   Example:
%     url = 'http://aviationweather.gov/gis/scripts/MetarJSON.php?bbox=6.11,46.23,6.12,46.24';
%     metar = json_decode(urlread(url));
%     disp(metar.features.properties);
%
%   Note:
%     This function implements a superset of JSON as specified in the original
%     RFC 4627 - it will also decode scalar types and NULL. RFC 4627 only
%     supports these values when they are nested inside an array or an object.
%     Although this superset is consistent with the expanded definition of
%     "JSON text" in the newer RFC 7159 (which aims to supersede RFC 4627),
%     this may cause interoperability issues with older JSON parsers that
%     adhere strictly to RFC 4627 when encoding a single scalar value.
%     See http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt for more information.
